# COP2000 - Introduction to Programming

## Description
The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to applications software design using structured programming concepts. This includes techniques for algorithm development, coding and testing. This course also provides an introduction to syntax and logic using a C-based language. It not only introduces a variety of concepts, but also discusses the most significant aspects of object-oriented programming. In addition to explaining concepts, the course uses programming assignments to reinforce the material in each chapter.[^1]

## Projects
- [Project 1](./Project%201/) a basic program akin to a "hello world".
- [Project 2](./Project%202/) preforms some basic calculations from user input to find the area of a circle, parallelogram, and triangle.
- [Project 3](./Project%203/) lists the freezing and boiling points of several substances
- [Project 4](./Project%204/) console style population histogram for five inputed values.
- [Project 5](./Project%205/) payroll report for the fictitious company XYZ, Inc.
- [Project 6](./Project%206/) simple program that introduces OOP with C++ by creating a Rectangle class. The class is then initalized with user inputted values. 
- [Project 7](./Project%207/) decrypts a message from a file in a very deterministic manner. The code includes example of c++ inheritance.
- [Project 8](./Project%208/) reads, sorts, and displays a table of numbers as even and odd numbers
